# [Processo e Sviluppo del Software] - Assignment 1

This project consists of a distributed application set up to make use of different DevOps tools. 


The core of the application is built on node.js, interfacing PostgreSQL for data management. Each environment which constitutes the webapp is going to be containerized with Docker.
The containers are going to be orchestrated with Kubernetes, guaranteeing scalability in production environments.
The system will be monitored through the joint use of Prometheus and Grafana.

The system will hence satisfy the requirements of Containerization, Provisioning and Monitoring requested by the assignment.
